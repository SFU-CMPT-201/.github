# CMPT 201 Systems Programming

The School of Computing Science is introducing a new course, CMPT 201 Systems Programming, that will
satisfy the curriculum requirements currently met by CMPT 300 Operating Systems for both CS and SoSy
students. Before officially offering CMPT 201, it is being made available in Fall 2023 as a Special
Topics course for interested students, CMPT 218. Any students who take this course will be able to
use it toward satisfying CMPT 300 requirements.

By taking this course, students will learn:

* User-level services and abstractions provided by operating systems
* How to write low-level programs that utilize those services and abstractions correctly,
  efficiently, and reliably, using Linux

Students will be equipped with important practical and theoretical background for upper-level
courses. Topics covered in this course include (but not limited to):

* Memory management
* Concurrency
* Storage and file system abstractions
* Communication abstractions such as IPC, sockets, and RPC
* Basics of OS security and cryptographic functions.

Prerequisites are:

* (CMPT 125 or CMPT 135) and MACM 101, all with a minimum grade of C-
* Proficiency in C programming (e.g., writing CMPT 125- or CMPT 135-level programs in C without
  getting help)
* Experience in using the command-line interface on Linux

Students are expected to achieve proficiency in the following areas:

* Interacting with, and programming in, a Linux environment using the command-line interface.
* Utilizing programming tools such as build systems and debuggers.
* Manipulating and managing data in memory correctly.
* Understanding concurrency concepts such as semaphores, locks, critical sections, deadlocks, common
  concurrency patterns, etc.
* Programming with processes and threads.
* Understanding file system abstractions and programming with them.
* Understanding communication abstractions such as IPC, sockets, and RPC and programming with them.
* Understanding cryptographic functions and programming with them.

## Grading (tentative)

* Midterm: 15%
* Final: 15%
* Programming assignments and in-class activities: 70%

## Grading Policies

* All submissions should be done on GitHub Classroom and/or CourSys. Email submissions are not
  accepted.
* Submissions that do not follow the instructions down to the letter receive a zero.
* Late submissions are not accepted.
* All members of the same group receive the same grade (if there is a group).
* Students must attain an overall passing grade on the weighted average of exams
  (quizzes/midterms/final) in the course in order to obtain a clear pass (C- or better).

## Academic Integrity Policies

* All submitted work should be your own. For example, if you copy code from the Internet or from
  your peers, it is not your own work.
* You should not allow others to copy your code either. For example, your peer should not copy your
  code and you should not post your code on the Internet.
* Any violations of academic integrity receive an F for the course.
* We generally follow [the academic integrity policies from the
  university](http://www.sfu.ca/students/academicintegrity.html).
